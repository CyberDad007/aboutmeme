          Zoey Elizabeth Iris O'Day is a very Happy Baby. She enjoys sleeping and drinking milk.

          Little Zoey, more than 6 months old, has transformed into a tiny ball of mischief and charm. Her latest antics involve a love affair with spoonsâ€”apparently, they make for excellent percussion instruments. Every mealtime is a mini concert, with Zoey banging on her high chair tray with unmatched enthusiasm, convinced she's the next baby drumming prodigy. To add to the hilarity, she has discovered the joy of mimicking animal sounds, and her attempts at "meowing" when she sees the family cat are nothing short of adorable. Zoey's newfound love for exploring her reflection in mirrors has turned her daily diaper changes into impromptu fashion shows, with her giving approving giggles and claps for her own stylish outfits. The house is filled with laughter and joy as Zoey continues to sprinkle each day with her infectious blend of curiosity and cuteness.

          Baby Zoey Elizabeth Iris O'Day works very very hard every day to crawl. She will very soon be taking her first steps in life.
